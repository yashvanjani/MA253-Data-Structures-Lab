Implement insertion on Reb-Black tree.
A class 'rbtree' is defined in 'rbtree.h'.
The names of the member functions are in ono-to-one correspondance with 'Cormen'
and they are supposed to do the same job as described in the textbook.

Notice that, like Cormen, we are using a sentinel node named 'nil' in stead of NULL pointer.
However, unlike Cormen, in our case 'nil' is the pointer to the sentinel node rather than the node itself.
'nil' is initialized, using dynamic allocation, inside the constructor rbtree::rbtree (in rbtree.cpp).
