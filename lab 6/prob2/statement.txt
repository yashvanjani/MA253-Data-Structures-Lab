TreeInsert() is a member function of class bst. It is declared inside 'bst.h'
Implement TreeInsert() inside 'bst.cpp'

insert() and removelt() are declared inside 'helper.h'
Implement insert() and removelt() inside 'helper.cpp'

insert(t,k,s) should create a node containing key k and satellite data s
(use dynamic allocation to create the node. see 'node.h' for the structure of node)
and then insert that node into the tree t using TreeInsert()

removelt(t,x) should remove, from tree t,  all the nodes whose satellite data is less than x.
