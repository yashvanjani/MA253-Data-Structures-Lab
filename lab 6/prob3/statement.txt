TreeInsert(), Size() and Height are member functions of class bst which are declared inside 'bst.h'
Implement these functions inside 'bst.cpp'

Given a ponter x to a node,
Size(x) should return the total number of nodes in the subtree rooted at x.
Height(x) should return the height of the subtree rotted at x.
We follow the convention s.t. height of empty subtree is -1 and height of subtree containg only one node is 0.

insert() is declared inside 'helper.h'
Implement insert() inside 'helper.cpp'

insert(t,k,s) should create a node containing key k and satellite data s
(use dynamic allocation to create the node. see 'node.h' for the structure of node)
and then insert that node into the tree t using TreeInsert()
