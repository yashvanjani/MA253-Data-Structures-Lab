Implement a 3-array Min-Heap.
Each node (except for the last few) in this heap has 3 children.
Also, being a Min-Heap, it satisfies the following "Min Heap Property" -
 key of parent node is less than or equal to the keys of the child nodes.

Heap elements are stored in array.
Each element is identified by its array index. 
Implement the following two functions. (these are NOT member funtions)
int Parent(int)
int Child(int,int)

Parent(i) should return the index of the parent of thr i-th element.
Child(i,j) assumes that j is 1,2 or 3.
Child(i,1),Child(i,2) and Child(i,3) should return the indices of
 first, second and third child of the i-th element.

A class 'heap' is defined in 'heap.h'. Class 'heap' has a member 'A'.
'A' is an integer array which stores the heap elements.
Implement the following member functions.
void MinHeapify(int);
void BuildMinHeap(void);
void Heapsort(void);

Heapsort() should sort the element in DESCENDING order.
