Implement a 3-array Min-Heap (as described in the previos problem).
And use it as priority queue (where the minimum element has highest priority).

Copy the implementations of following functions from the previous problem.
int Parent(int)
int Child(int,int)
void MinHeapify(int)

Now implement the following member functions of class 'heap'.
int HeapMinimum(void)
int HeapExtractMin(void)
void HeapDecreaseKey(int,int)
void MinHeapInsert(int)
